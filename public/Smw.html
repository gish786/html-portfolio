    <h2> 1- 295 </h2>
    <p> It is not a song actually it is a slap on present goverment, Fake religious beleivers and the haters.</p>
    <h2> 2- Signed To God </h2>
    <p> This song is beyond my imagination.</p>
    <h2> 3- Bappu </h2>
    <p> This song is very close to my heart as it replicates the concern of a son towards his father and telling his father now it's my turn.</p>
